# IT-C 347 Lab 1
### *Practical Lab - Software Setup*
## Introduction

We are going to have a lot of fun. We’re going to use the semi-wonderful program called GNS3. It is a very powerful and capable network virtualization program. With it you will be building one master lab over the course of the whole semester. In this lab you will be dealing with lots of networking areas: IP Addressing, Subnetting, VLANs, Switches, Routers, Packet Capture and, if we have time, some Advanced Networking Technologies (optional lab).

## Cisco Academy

Cisco Academy is a wonderful resource for anyone who wants to grow, deepen or sharpen their networking skills, as Cisco is very dominate in the networking field. In this class we will be focusing a lot on Cisco and Cisco iOS in relation to setting up switches and routers.
To begin, go to the following and create your account:

You are welcome to work on any of these labs to further your skills in addition to what we do in this class.
There is also a wonderful resource called GNS3 Vault that also has labs that you can work on if you wish.

## GNS3 Install

Now for the fun part, installing GNS3. This comes in 3 parts: installing GNS3, installing VMWare Workstation Pro (or Virtual Box if you really want to hate your life), and importing the GNS3 VM. 
To get the GNS3 software head to the following website, make an account and then download the software:

[GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/)

I recommend also downloading the GNS3 VM file that is specific to VMWare Workstation Pro. You can use Virtual Box if you wish. But like I said, it will not be an enjoyable experience for you.
Now before you actually install GNS3, I recommend installing the VMWare and the GNS3 first, as it makes it easier for the initial setup of the GNS3 software.

## VMWare Workstation Pro Install

VMWare Workstation is an extremely powerful software with great features. BYU has been gracious enough to give us a license as students so that we don’t have to purchase it (hint it’s expensive). This info is all found at [BYU Software](https://software.byu.edu/workstation). You can download VMWare Workstation from the following website:
[VMWare Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)

Here is the license key that you will need:
> 5423P-QG20L-J8TJ2-0R3U4-147QH

## GNS3 VM Import

Once that is all installed you will want to do as follows to import the VM.

## GNS3 VM Settings

After you have imported the VM you’ll want to tweak some of the settings for the VM (we’ll also tweak these within GNS3). Basically, we’re giving the VM some more resources to work with. You can adjust these to your liking and to the extent your system can handle. The following settings are a minimum recommendation for the labs:

-	vCPU Cores: 4
-	RAM: 1 GB
